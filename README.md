Introduction
This SkyLiteDemo project serves as a comprehensive and practical showcase of the SkyLite framework's capabilities for building modern, data-driven web applications. It demonstrates how various UI controls and core framework features can be seamlessly integrated to create a cohesive, interactive, and personalized user experience. The application presents a classic dashboard-style interface, typical of an administrative portal or a logged-in user's home page, and effectively utilizes the framework's server-centric, AJAX-driven architecture.
Architectural and Feature Highlights
1. Core Architectural Patterns & Design Choices
The project consistently follows several powerful architectural patterns that are central to the SkyLite philosophy:
• Model-View (MV/EV) Pattern: The project is architected around a clear separation of concerns using "Main Views" (MV) for displaying lists of data and "Edit Views" (EV) for creating or editing individual records. This pattern is facilitated by a custom WebBase class that manages a ViewPart object, which acts as a ViewModel, holding the state and data for the current view.
• Single-Page Application (SPA)-like Navigation: The application avoids full page reloads for most actions. A main "shell" page (e.g., XysUser.vb) loads the master layout, and the content area is dynamically replaced with partial views (MV or EV) using ApiResponse commands (SetElementContents), creating a seamless user experience.
• Robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Security is deeply integrated. The WebBase class centralizes permission checking for both page access (ViewAccess()) and specific actions/methods (ViewMethods()). The UI is then dynamically rendered based on these permissions, ensuring users only see and interact with the functions they are authorized to use.
2. Key Modules and Functionality
• Authentication Flow (XysSignin, XysPass, XysVerify): A complete and secure authentication module demonstrating user lookup, password verification, cookie-based session management (AppKey), and a sign-up flow with email-based One-Time Passcodes (OTP).
• WebBase.vb - The Application's Core: This central class inherits from WebPage and provides shared functionality to all other pages, including session management, permission checking, dynamic menu/button generation, and loading of translation dictionaries. This drastically reduces code duplication and enforces consistency.
• Data-Driven UI (SQLGridSection): The "Main View" (*MV.vb) pages showcase the power of the SQLGridSection. The entire UI for displaying, paging, and sorting complex data is generated from a single, declarative SQLGridInfo object, which is directly tied to a SQL query.
• Dynamic Edit Forms: The "Edit View" (*EV.vb) pages demonstrate how to build data entry forms using a combination of Texts, Dropdown, CheckBox, and other controls. They contain the SaveView and DeleteView logic, including the use of parameterized queries for secure database updates.
• Translation Engine (Translator): The application is fully internationalized. All visible text is abstracted using Translator.Format("key"), with language dictionaries being loaded from the database for each page.
• File Management: The bulletin and user profile sections demonstrate handling file uploads, associating them with data records, and providing secure download links.
3. Code-Level Best Practices
• Parameterized Queries: All data manipulation functions use SqlParameter lists to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, a critical security practice.
• Centralized Constants: The References structure provides a single, strongly-typed source for all page names, session keys, and element IDs, making the code highly maintainable and reducing the risk of typos.
• Thin Client: The JavaScript files are kept minimal and are primarily responsible for gathering data from the DOM and initiating an $ApiRequest. All significant logic, validation, and UI orchestration are handled securely on the server.
Conclusion
The SkyLiteDemo project is a masterclass in building a secure, scalable, and maintainable web application with the SkyLite framework. Its architecture is perfectly suited for complex business applications like ERPs, CRMs, or internal admin portals where data integrity, role-based security, and rapid development of standardized forms are paramount. The clear separation of concerns through the MV/EV pattern and the power of high-level data-driven controls showcase a framework that is both powerful and elegantly designed for its purpose.
